# flash fictions
This is where I tried to write 12 flash fictions each day.

Write each fantasy/sci-fi flash fiction less than 10 words with month of the year as the main theme. (12 stories relating to 12 months)

For example of best flash fiction, from Ernest Hemingway:
**"For sale: baby shoes, never worn."**
